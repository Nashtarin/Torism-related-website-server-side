# Roam The World

Please visit my site [Roam The World](https://tourism-site-79a03.web.app/).

"Roam The World" is a travel agency which offers different offers for tourists and adventure lovers.I made this site with react,react-router, react-hook-form,bootstrap,mongodb as backend etc. I used firebase for hosting live site and Heroku for live server. 

* The website consists of main three routes at first, Home, About Us, Contact US
* A user can login using google sign in button, when a user at first click to the login button at the top right of the site, it will redirect it to login page where Google Sign In button remains, when the user logged in then a dashboard with dropdown menu comes with three route My orders, Manage All Orders, Add a new offfer.
* At home page there are six different sections,header,footer,offers,hajj package and air tickets carousel.
* At home page each offers has a button named Book Now,when user click this it will go to the place order page. However, the place order page is private/protected route, user must login to go there while he/she clicking the Book Now button in home page.Moreover, when the user logged in then user will be redirected automatically to that page where he/she were. In addition,in this private route if reloaded it will not go to the login page
* In Place Order page, at the left side it shows the detail information of the offer and at the right side there is a form for a user to fill up. However, name,email,cost are already written when the user logged in. User only have to fill certain fields. When the user click Place order button,a browser alert comes and says order placed successfully.
* In Manage All Orders route user can see all the orders that have been placed by all users, whereas in My Orders shows the orders only made by that user
* The Add a offer page the user can add a offer by giving certain information and clicking Add a offer,the offer will be added to the home page.
